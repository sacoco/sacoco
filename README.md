#About me 

I am a Colombian software engineer (computer scientist), I am still very young so I am too stupid, being born in a country with so many problems turns that stupidity into one of my greatest strengths as I constantly use my profession to help people and improve the quality of my country, I know, it sounds very inspiring and very patriotic however I am far from it.

I’m just a nice guy, I like leadership, geek stuff, sports and last but not least music(disco), I decided to form my own brand, it’s called sacoco, it doesn’t sound like the best brand in the world but those six letters represent my name and what I am, they represent my work as an engineer and the potential of my ideas, I’m so far starting but I plan to do great things.

If you like me, I leave you my projects, social networks and my contact so we can have a coffee.

# About me 

I am a Colombian software engineer (computer scientist)

Nice guy, I like leadership, geek stuff, sports and last but not least to listen music(disco music never dies). I decided to form my own brand it’s called sacoco, yeah it doesn’t sound pretty good but those six letters represent my name and what I am my work as an engineer and the potential of my ideas I’m so far starting but I plan to do great things.
